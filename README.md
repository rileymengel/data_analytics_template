### How to Create New Data Analytics Projects:

**How to Store Data**
Create a data folder at the root level of your repository
- **Store Raw Data**: Store raw, unprocessed data in a data/raw/ subfolder
- **Processed Data**: Store processed or cleaned data in a data/processed/ subfolder.
- **Interim Data**: Optionally, you can include a data/interim/ folder to store partially processed data or intermediary steps.

**How are Notebooks Stored**
Notebooks Folder: Use a notebooks/ folder to store all Jupyter notebooks.
* **Notebook Management**: Organize notebooks by their purpose or workflow stage
* **Saving and Syncing**: Work on Jupyter notebooks locally on your laptop, saving frequently. After making significant changes, commit and push these changes to your repository.
* **Readme Documentation**: Ensure your repositoryâ€™s README.md file includes brief documentation on the purpose of each notebook

**Other Folders/Subfolders**
Organizing additional folders based on functionality keeps the repository structured and allows easy navigation. Consider including the following
* **figures**: Create a figures/ folder to store any output plots, graphs, or visualizations generated by notebooks or scripts.
* **models**: Save model files, such as serialized machine learning models, in a models/ folder.
* **docs**: Include a docs/ folder for documentation files that provide in-depth explanations of the code, methods, or project structure
* **config**: If your project requires configuration files (e.g., JSON or YAML files), store them in a config/ folder.
